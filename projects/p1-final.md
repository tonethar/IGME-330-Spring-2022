## I. Requirements

1) Everything from the prevous checkpoints is still required - 4 pages (and probably one more for this version if you are using Firebase), global navigation system, uses Bulma, uses a web service or data source and so on.

2) Every time the user clicks the search button, this App page WILL automatically save the last term searched by the user and the third control's UI *state* in the browser's `localStorage` - this was covered in IGME-230/235 here --> [Web Apps 9 - WebStorage API](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/web-apps-9.md):
    - we are going to test this capability by typing in a search term, changing a value of the 3rd control, doing a search, and then closing the browser window. When we re-open the window, the user's last search term must be visible, and the rest of the UI should be in the same *state*
    - you will store this app state in an *object literal* under a single "key" named `abc1234-p1-settings` (where `abc1234` is your "banjo id")
    - storing object literals in `localStorage` is covered here - [Web Apps 9 - WebStorage API - Storing Objects with Web Storage](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/web-apps-9.md#iii-storing-objects-with-web-storage)
    - we also covered it in the [Week 6A `localStorage` demo](../weekly/06A.md#iv-localstorage-demo)

3) The app must have a 4th web component - and it must be `<app-navbar>` - this navbar must have "you are here" cues such as bold text

4) The app must use `fetch()` instead of `XHR`

5) The app must use either Mapbox or Firebase:
  - If you are using Mapbox, you probably should NOT do a full-screen interface like we did in the Maps II HW. Much of the time, a smaller map, and displaying more textual information, makes sense. For example, see how Yelp handles maps - https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Garbage+Plate&find_loc=Rochester%2C+NY+14604
    - you MUST have markers in the map - these will likely show a user's search results
    - the markers MUST be clickable and display useful information
    - there MUST be map controls for the user
    - new searches will probably wipe out "old" markers from previous searches
    - if you want to add layers to your map, see the [Mapbox-III - Virus Map extra credit assignment](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-mapbox-3.md)
  - If you are using Firebase, you will probably be meeting that requirement with a **"Community"** page, which shows the favorites of ALL of the app's users
    - We are covering Firebase on 7B and 8A
    - You must to save (WRITE) some sort of web site data to "the cloud" using Firebase (typed in user search terms, favorited Pokemon, etc):
      - [2 - Firebase Highscore App](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/firebase-2.md) covers how to save data to the cloud using Firebase
    - You must add a **community.html** page or similar that will display (READ) at least some of this data to your users
      - [3 - Firebase Highscore Viewer](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/firebase-3.md) covers how to read data from the cloud using Firebase
    - Important Note: 
      - Individual data - a user's favorites and other user data (such as the last term searched by that user and other UI state) MUST still be stored in the browser's local storage and displayed on your **favorites.html** page
      - **community.html** will shows favorites (or other data) for ALL of the users

6) The app must be easy to use, with well-labeled and obvious controls:
    - the search button is prominent, in an obvious location, stands out from the rest of the UI (give it an appropriate Bulma style/color for a search button) and "looks like a button"
    - controls should have meanigful labels and/or tooltips (use the `title` attribute)
    - the controls and input fields should have meaningful default values so that the user does not have to struggle to figure out how to use your app
    - mousing over a control (such as a "Favorite Me" button) should highlight the button so that the user knows that its active. Use CSS `:hover` or JavaScript `onmouseover` / `onmouseout` etc to change properties of the control

7) The app must always "let the user know what's going on" with *activity indicators*:
    - use the `is-loading` Bulma class to get a "spinner" on a button - https://bulma.io/documentation/elements/button/
    - use a Bulma "Indeterminate Progress Bar" - https://bulma.io/documentation/elements/progress/#indeterminate
    - if a search result on a card is *favorited*, then the "Favorite Me!" button should change state to indicate that particular result cannot be favorited again

8) The app must "fail gracefully" and errors must be communicated to the user - for example:
    - "No results found" message if a search comes back with no results
    - "Please enter a search term" if the user clicks the search button without typing anything in

9) The app must have "Impact":
    - it serves a purpose - i.e it should be useful to someone
    - it is easy to use, functional, and aesthetically pleasing
    - it should be (or approaching) "portfolio quality" - something you would be able to show a potential employer

## II. Code Standards
- All project files MUST adhere to this --> [IGME-330 - Course Code Style Requirements](330-code-style.md) 
- All `<script>` tags MUST be in the `<head>` section of the document and be of `type="module"`
- All web components are in their own JS file. Component file names MUST match their tag name - example - the file that contains the `<sw-card>` code must be named **sw-card.js**
- All web components must accept at least 1 *parameter* and utilize it. A parameter can be passed in via slots, attributes or via an object property
- Simplify the code in your web components and eliminate any redudant code:
  - for example, if you are just using slots and there's no JavaScript in the component, you probably don't need any of the lifecycle methods, nor do you even need a `render()` helper method. The `template` and a `constructor()` should suffice
- All HTML pages must pass HTML validation - this includes your web components too
  - be sure to test your **app.html** and **favorite.html** pages AFTER you've loaded in some results and instantiated - for example - some `<sw-card>` component instances 
  - https://validator.w3.org/
- All CSS must pass CSS validation
  - https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

## III. Demo Video

- A 1 to 2-minute narrated demo video of the completed project is required
- You can post it to YouTube & put the URL in the dropbox comments field
- If you decide to upload a video file instead, it must be in the MP4 format
- The easiest way to record a demo video is to use Zoom - here is a 2-minute video on how to do this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D617OXKhSYw
  - another popular option for creating videos is [OBS](https://obsproject.com/download)
  - don't forget to "Share Screen" so that I can see you interacting with the project
  - don't forget to record your narration too, and be sure to use a better microphone than the one that came with your laptop `:-)`
- Please don't stress out over this requirement - I am the only one who will see the video - I won't be sharing or posting these
- **10% deducted from project 1 grade if this video requirement is not completed**
