## I. Checkpoint Rubric First
- Worth 5% of Final Course Grade
- Out of 25 points

    A. (2 points) - [Home Page](#ii-content-requirements---home-page) has required content
    
    B. (8 points) - [App Page](#iii-functional-requirements---app-page) requirements are met

    C. (5 points) - [Favorites Page](#iv-functional-requirements---favorites-page) requirements are met
    
    D. (3 points) - [Documentation Page](#v-content-requirements---aboutdocumentation-page) has required content
    
    E. (2 points) - Bulma is utilized for navigation, text, buttons App UI etc throughout all 4 pages of the site
    
    F. (2 points) - App page UI state and app favorites are preserved in `localStorage` inside a single object literal. The `localStorage` key (there is only one) is uniquely named as required below

    G. (1 point) - There is "mobile friendly" navigation with a functioning hamburger menu on all pages

    H. (1 point) - The app now utilizes 3 distinct web components (the "card" component from the App page, and the 2 web components from checkpoint #1)

    I. (1 point) - Follows [IGME-330 - Course Code Style Requirements](./330-code-style.md)
    
    J. (***Deductions***) - points will be deducted for P1 - [Checkpoint #1 requirements](p1-checkpoint-1.md) that are still not met

<hr>


## II. Content Requirements - *Home page*

1. Tell the user what your app does
    - Have some sort of "brand" for your page:
      - it could be a `navbar-brand` like in the Bulma template - an image or font awesome icon
      - it could be a stylized logo you create yourself
    - You might want to use a Bulma `hero`
2. There must be at least one image on this page (in addition to whatever appears in `navbar-brand`)
3. *Optional: Consider adding some sort interactive content or "flare" to this page - an image carousel, random quotes from happy users, etc*

<hr>

## III. Functional Requirements - *App page*

1. The app WILL utilize at least **ONE** web service API (or approved data source)

2. The app WILL provide the user (minimally) with the following 3 controls

    - a button for searching
    - an `<input type="text">` they can type a search term into
    - you will also provide one other control for the user - for example - to filter or limit the number of results. It could be a `<select>` (which is a pulldown menu) or a `<input type="number">` (which is a number "stepper") that is used to set such a limit
    - *optionally*, you could have even more controls on this page - radio buttons, checkboxes, sliders etc - whatever makes the app more useful for the end user

3. The above controls ARE ALL styled by Bulma classes - https://bulma.io/documentation/form/general/

4. Functionality: when the use clicks the button, results WILL be downloaded and then displayed on the screen

5. These results WILL be displayed using a custom "card" component that was created by you
    - refer to [HW - Web Components-3](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-wc-3.md) and the `<sw-card>` component as an example

6. ***\*\*This "UI state preservation" requirement has been deferred to the final project deliverable, you do not have to do this for checkpoint #2\*\**** 

~~Every time the user clicks the search button, this App page WILL automatically save the last term searched by the user and the third control's UI *state* in the browser's `localStorage` - this was covered in IGME-230/235 here --> [Web Apps 9 - WebStorage API](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/web-apps-9.md):
    - we are going to test this capability by typing in a search term, changing a value of the 3rd control, doing a search, and then closing the browser window. When we re-open the window, the user's last search term must be visible, and the rest of the UI should be in the same *state*
    - you will store this app state in an *object literal* under a single "key" named `abc1234-p1-settings` (where `abc1234` is your "banjo id")
    - storing object literals in `localStorage` is covered here - [Web Apps 9 - WebStorage API - Storing Objects with Web Storage](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/web-apps-9.md#iii-storing-objects-with-web-storage)~~

7. There WILL be a "Favorites" button that adds individual search results to the *Favorites page* - see below

<hr>


## IV. Functional Requirements - *Favorites page*

1. The favorites (or lists or bookmarks) WILL be stored in `localStorage` 
    - in the same object literal
    - and under the same `abc1234-p1-settings` "key" referenced above

2. These favorites WILL automatically appear on the page when the user first loads it

3. There MUST be a be a *Delete* button that clears `localStorage` (thus removing the favorites from the page)

4. *Optional* - if there are a lot of favorites, the user will probably be able to interact with them in some other way - "View Next 5" and "View Previous 5" buttons

5. *Optional* - the user can also sort, re-order and delete individual favorites

<hr>

## V. Content Requirements - *About/Documentation page* 
- Keep your project proposal from checkpoint #1 - and put it under a PROPOSAL subheading
- Have the following additional 6 sub-headings on your page (see the [example Desktop screenshots of sources.html](#desktop-sources-screenshots) below
  - PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:

    - Link to the API Home, documentation, and endpoints used (but don't include your API key!)
  - NOTEWORTHY: (you can leave this section blank for now)
    - Talk the project up - list the technologies you used (web components, Bulma, fetch, promises, etc)
    - Be sure to emphasize what you did outside of what we covered in class
  - GRADING: (you can leave this section blank for now - ***Required with Final Submission only***)
    - Describe how you met project requirements
    - Describe how you went "above and beyond" project requirements
    - In the comments field of the dropbox, grade your Project 1 submission
  - TO DO:  (you can leave this section blank for now - ***Required with Final Submission only***)

## VI. Sample Screenshots

<a id="desktop-screenshots"/>

### VI-A. Desktop Version

<hr>

**about.html**

- Note that the nav bar has a "you are here" cue - the current page name is in **bold** text. This was a checkpoint #1 requirement, and still needs to be done for checkpoint #2.

![screenshot](_images/p1-desktop-ss-1.png)

<hr>

**app.html**

- This has the 3 required controls:
  - a `<select>` for choosing a dog breed (most of you will have a text input instead)
  - a `<select>` for choosing a `limit` on the maximum number of results you want
  - a search `<button>` 
  - the 4th control - the "Clear All Results!" button, is NOT required
- "Card" Component:
  - this has the required card component to display each results
  - each card has a "Favorite Me!" button that adds that card to the favorites list
  - the styles for this card were pulled directly from Bulma's site - https://bulma.io/documentation/components/card/#examples
- Other Components:
  - each page also has a "header" and a "footer" component
  - in this checkpoint you are required to have a minimum of 3 distinct component classes - the "card component" above and two other components

![screenshot](_images/p1-desktop-ss-2.png)

<hr>

**favorites.html**
- The favorites (as cards) are shown automatically when the user comes to the page
- The "Clear All Favorites" button is required
- The "Clear All App Preferences" button is NOT required 
- To display the favorites, I am using a slightly modified duplicate of **app.html**'s "Card" Component (i.e. got rid of "Favorite Me" button)
- *Note that for this checkpoint you are not required to delete individual favorites, you merely have to give the user the option to delete them ALL*

**documentation.html**
- Note: The "Documentation" text in the navbar should be **bold** in this screenshot!

## VII. Resources
- [GIF Finder](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-gif-finder.md) might be some helpful review on how `XHR` works, and how to pass query parameters to a web service

<hr>

## VIII. Think ahead to the final project deliverable ...
- ... and get started on these requirements as soon as you can!
- The app must have a 4th web component - `<app-navbar>`
- The app must use `fetch()` instead of `XHR`
- The app must use either Mapbox or Firebase
- The app must be easy to use, with well-labeled and obvious controls:
  - the search button is prominent, in an obvious location, stands out from the rest of the UI (give it an appropriate Bulma style for a seach button) and "looks like a button"
  - controls can have labels and/or tooltips (use the `title` attribute)
- The app must always "let the user know what's going on" with activity indicators
  - use the `is-loading` Bulma class to get a "spinner" on a button - https://bulma.io/documentation/elements/button/
  - use a Bulma "Indeterminate Progress Bar" - https://bulma.io/documentation/elements/progress/#indeterminate
- The app must "fail gracefully" and errors must be communicated to the user - for example:
  - "No results found" message if a search comes back with no results
  - "Please enter a search term" if the user clicks the search button without typing anything in
- The app must have "Impact":
  - it serves a purpose - i.e it should be useful to someone
  - it is easy to use, functional, and aesthetically pleasing
  - it should be (or approaching) "portfolio quality" - something you would be able to show a potential employer



<!--
## II. Project 1 Final 
- Worth 15% of Final Grade 

    A. The Favorites Page now functions - it will use localStorage to storage user specific app favorites locally. All of the app favorites are preserved in localStorage inside of the single object literal used in Project 1 Checkpoint. The favorites will be displayed using a custom web component

    B) The App will utilize Firebase to create a Community page

    **OR**

- The App will utilize Mapbox and display location data that is returned by a web service. The app will not solely display hard-coded (or locally stored) location data

    C) App navigation now has "You are here cues" (ex. **bold** text or a different colored background, NOT literally the words "You Are Here")
    
    D) App navigation is now a web component

    E) App Page Improvements:

    1. animated button or element letting the user know when a search is going on

    F) Design & Interaction 

    1. Pleasing graphic design
    1. Users must be able to figure out how to use the app with minimal instruction
      - be sure to provide instruction and tooltips if necessary
    1. User errors must be handled gracefully
      - for example, if the user forgets to type in a search term before clicking the Search button, the app should tell the user something like "Please enter a search term first"
    1. Users must know what *state* the app is in at all times
