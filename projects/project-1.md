## II. Project 1 Final 
- Worth 15% of Final Grade 

    A. The Favorites Page now functions - it will use localStorage to storage user specific app favorites locally. All of the app favorites are preserved in localStorage inside of the single object literal used in Project 1 Checkpoint. The favorites will be displayed using a custom web component

    B) The App will utilize Firebase to create a Community page

    **OR**

- The App will utilize Mapbox and display location data that is returned by a web service. The app will not solely display hard-coded (or locally stored) location data

    C) App navigation now has “You are here cues” (ex. Bolded text, different colored background, NOT literally the words “You Are Here”). App navigation is now a component

    D) App Page Improvements:

      1. animated button or element letting the user know when a search is going on

    E) Design & Interaction 

        - Pleasing graphic design
        - Users must be able to figure out how to use the app with minimal instruction
          - be sure to provide instruction and tooltips if necessary
        - User errors must be handled gracefully
          - for example, if the user forgets to type in a search term before clicking the Search button, the app should tell the user something like "Please enter a search term first"
        - Users must know what *state* the app is in at all times
