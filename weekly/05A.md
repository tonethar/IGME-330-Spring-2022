## II. Finish up Web Components

- [HW - Web Components-4 - Walk through a `<my-list>` component](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-wc-4.md)
  - demos `set`/`get` in a web component
  - PS - web components use JS `class` syntax - so their instances are regular JS objects - and can do anything JS objects/classes can do
  - let's us pass reference types (arrays/object) normally
- [HW - Web Components-5 - Dispatching Custom Events](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-wc-5.md)
- [Web Components-6 - Building a "pubsub" object aka "Publish/Subscribe"](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Spring-2022/blob/main/weekly/05A.md) (NOT assigned as HW)
- Final thoughts on Web Components:
  - Slots
    - *unnamed* slots work well if you only have one value to pass in
    - *named* slots let you easily "plug in" 2 or more values into multiple locations in your HTML template
    - if you have a large amount of text and HTML content, you should use slots instead of attributes (one advantage: the text will be easier to read and format in a slot)
  - Attributes
  - Slots & attributes are both easy for you to edit (and also for non-programmers to edit them, like in a CMS!)
  - When to consider using custom JS properties instead of the above (like we did in wc-5):
    - your component is not being embedded in an HTML file and is instead being created dynamically in code
    - you are passing in an array to an attribute (remember that it gets *stringified*, and then we have to later `split()` it to use it)
    - you are passing in a lot of string attributes - when instead you could pass in a single object reference instead:
      - think about `<sw-card>` and its 6+ attributes  - it might have been better to just pass in an object reference that contained all of the character data
