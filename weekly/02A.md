# Week 2A - ES6 Modules & Ajax (Text & CSV)

## I. ES6 Modules

## II. Review the HW
- [Technobabble II](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-technobabble-2.md)
  - CSS media queries with phone, tablet and desktop breakpoints
- [Technobabble III](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-technobabble-3.md)
  - Media queries (CSS `display` property)
  - Creating one function that will be called by both buttons (need to pass parameters from an event handler)

## III. Ajax - loading text & CSV

- [HW - Ajax-1 - loading and parsing text files](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-1.md)
- [HW - Ajax-2 - loading and parsing CSV files](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-2.md)
  - In the example above, we used the CSV format to store 3 arrays of data: line 1 had dog names, line 2 had cat names and line 3 had bird names
  - The above is a legitimate use for the CSV format, but more typically:
    - CSV is used to store multiple *records*, where each line of the CSV file is a distinct *entity*
    - for example, each line of a **customers.csv** file could represent information about the customer, and the various pieces of data about that customer are separated by commas (`lastName`, `firstName`, `address`, `city`, `state`, `zip`, `countryCode` and so on)
  - See some CSV example files here - https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/csv.html
  - The major ***advantages*** of the CSV file format are: 
    - it has a very small file size compared to files encoded in XML or JSON
    - it is easy to import into spreadsheets
    - is very "portable" when utilizing the data in different programming languages and data applications
  - The major ***disadvantages*** of the CSV file format:
    - you are limited to the `String` type only
    - the meaning and type of the values is not labeled (as it is in XML and JSON) and is instead determined solely by the order (position) of the value on each line
    - CSV can NOT easily represent complex data types such as nested objects or arrays
    - Some other disadvantages of CSV are listed here: https://ourtechroom.com/tech/what-is-csv-file-how-to-open-csv-file-when-to-use-csv-file/#mcetoc_1f8gucbjl13

## III. Breakout Groups

- Your mission (with a partner) is to write code that follows the **DRY** software development principle:
  - Clicking the "Load Taffy Info" button in the screenshot below will load and display the contents of the **taffy-facts.txt** file
  - Clicking the "Load Viking Info" button will load and display the contents of the **viking-facts.txt** file
  - You will create a `loadTextXHR()` helper function named that accepts 2 parameters - `url` and `callback`
    - `url` is the path to the file you want to download with `XHR`
    - `callback` is the function you want to have called when the file has downloaded. This callback function will update the appropriate part of the page with the downloaded HTML fragment
  - the two buttons in the screenshot below are both calling the same `loadTextXHR()` function, but passing in different values for the 2 parameters
