# Week 10A - Finish up basic canvas

## I. Review HW Concepts

- 3 - [Canvas 2D Essential Skills #3 - Begin making a screensaver](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/3-begin-making-screensaver.md):
  - Concepts:
    - animation & writing a helper function
  - Docs:
    - [`window.requestAnimationFrame()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame)
- 4 - [Canvas 2D Essential Skills #4 - Adding Controls](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/4-adding-controls.md)
  - Concepts:
    - Adding interactivity to our screensaver with a simple UI
    - Toggling animation on & off
    - Getting coordinates of where the user clicks on the canvas
    - Drawing state *stack*
    - "Pure" functions with no "side effects" - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function
  - Docs:
    - [`ctx.save()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/save)
    - [`ctx.restore()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/restore)
- 5 - [Canvas 2D Essential Skills #5 - Write some code!](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/5-write-some-code.md)
  - No video
  - You will writing code that creates new helper functions and UI
  - Recommendation: this should not be particularly difficult, but don't put it off until an hour before it's due

## II. Smooth Canvas Animations

- A slight topic segueway, but something to be aware of
- To get the smoothest canvas animations, and to account for the differing framerates that [`window.requestAnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) gives you, it's best to calculate a "delta time" to use when drawing animations 
- See demos here: https://people.rit.edu/~acjvks/shared/330/canvas/smooth-animation/
