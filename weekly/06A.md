# Week 6A

## I. Exam #1 is next time
- Any questions that were not answered [last time](05B.md#i-exam-1) ?

<hr>

## II. Project 1 - Deliverable #2 - questions?

- [Project 1 - VanillaJS App of Awesomeness - Checkpoint #2 - Working Prototype](../projects/p1-checkpoint-2.md)
- Today's `localStorage` demo will probably help out!

<hr>

## III. CORS, Authentication & Proxy Servers
- What is a [Proxy Server](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/proxy-server) ?
- Sample code & links: look in the myCourses content section under "CORS"
  - iTunes Search API example
  - Yelp API Authentication Example
- MOST of you don't need to worry about this issue for Project 1, and will not need to set up a Proxy Server, but this is still good to be aware of
 
<hr>

## IV. `localStorage` Demo
- This could be a nice helper for the P1 Checkpoint #2 requirements
- Look for **local-storage-demo-start.zip** in myCourses
- Bulma stuff
  - Both pages:
    - navbar with functional mobile navigation and "you are here" cues
    - pass HTML validation with no errors or warning
    - `<hotdog-footer>` web component - 
  - **app.html**
    - has a 2-column layout
    - Bulma [`.box`](https://bulma.io/documentation/elements/box/) class
    - styles the buttons with Bulma
    - styles the width of the text inputs with a regular CSS *attribute selector*
  - **favorites.html**
- ES6 modules stuff:
  - all `<script>` tags are of `type=module` and are all located in the `<head>` section of the document
  - all JS passes [ESLint](https://eslint.org/demo)
  - there is a **eslintrc.json** file in a **_dev** folder - the app doesn't need it for anything - it's just there for reference 
 - `localStorage` stuff
- more `localStorage` stuff (not needed for P1)
  - uses a `window.onstorage` event handler to communicate between tabs and windows that `localStorage` has changed, and update the window or tab immediately

<hr>

## V. `fetch()` & Promises
- This is optinal for Checkpoint #2, and required for the final version of Project 1. So we won't look at it too closely until next week
- [HW - Ajax-5 - the fetch() API](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-5.md)
- [HW - Ajax-6 - async & await with the fetch() API](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-6.md)
