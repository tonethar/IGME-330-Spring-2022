# Week 6A

## I. Exam #1 is next time
- Any questions that were not answered [last time](05B.md#i-exam-1) ?

<hr>

## II. Project 1 - Deliverable #2 - questions?

- [Project 1 - VanillaJS App of Awesomeness - Checkpoint #2 - Working Prototype](../projects/p1-checkpoint-2.md)
- Today's `localStorage` demo will probably help out!

<hr>

## III. CORS, Authentication & Proxy Servers
- What is a [Proxy Server](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/proxy-server) ?
  - a good place to hide your API key, and hide the end user's IP address
  - also good if the web service requires server-side authentication via HTTP headers - ex. [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth)
- Sample code & links: look in the myCourses content section under "CORS"
  - iTunes Search API example
  - Yelp API Authentication Example
- MOST of you don't need to worry about this issue for Project 1, and will not need to set up a Proxy Server, but this is still good to be aware of

## IV. `localStorage` Demo
- This could be a nice helper for the P1 Checkpoint #2 requirements
- Look for **local-storage-demo-start.zip** in myCourses
- Bulma stuff
  - Both pages:
    - navbar with functional mobile navigation and "you are here" cues
    - pass HTML validation with no errors or warning
    - `<hotdog-footer>` web component - note that it uses `<slot>`s and the code contains only a constructor, as it does not need any other lifecycle or helper methods
  - **app.html**
    - has a 2-column layout
    - Bulma [`.box`](https://bulma.io/documentation/elements/box/) class
    - styles the buttons with Bulma
    - styles the width of the text inputs with a regular CSS *attribute selector*
- ES6 modules stuff:
  - all `<script>` tags are of `type=module` and are all located in the `<head>` section of the document
  - all JS passes [ESLint](https://eslint.org/demo)
  - there is a **loader.js** file, linked to from both HTML pages,  for importing the `<hotdog-footer>` component and hamburger code
  - each HTML page is its own *application* with distinct functionality, therefore each page will load its own JS file 
    - **app.js** is loaded by the **app.html** page and does "appy things"
    - **favorites.js** is loaded by the **favorites.html** page and does "favority things"
  - there is a **eslintrc.json** file in a **_dev** folder - the app doesn't need it for anything - it's just there for reference 
- `localStorage` stuff:
  - there is a **localStorage.js** file that contains utility functions that help with accessing `localStorage`
  - **app.js** links to this file. On this page we have functionality that allows the user to change the title of the web site, as well as add items to the favorites list.
  - **favorites.js** also links to **localStorage.js**, and has functionality for reading and displaying the favorites, emptying the favorites list, and resetting the app title to the  default value
- more `localStorage` stuff (not needed for P1)
  - uses a `window.onstorage` event handler to communicate between tabs and windows that `localStorage` has changed, and update the window or tab immediately

## V. `fetch()` & Promises & Maps
- Any quick questions on these technologies?
- `fetch()` is optional for Checkpoint #2, and required for the final version of Project 1 .. so we won't look at it too closely until next week
  - [HW - Ajax-5 - the fetch() API](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-5.md)
  - [HW - Ajax-6 - async & await with the fetch() API](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-6.md)
- Mapbox is also optional for Checkpoint #2 .. so we'll do a quick review of it next week
