## Overview

- Welcome Back!
- Look at some Project 1 Submissions
- A few topics before we move on to canvas:
  - Comformance testing
  - Performance Testing
  - Web Components - `<main-app>` - *one component to rule them all!*
  - React Demo
- Quizes/Exams
  - Quiz #3 - handed out today - due next Tuesday 10A
  - Exam #2 will be given on 11B
  - Exam #3 will be given on 14B (last day of class)

## I. Conformance testing

- **Software conformance testing** is testing that verifies that a product performs according to its specified standards
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformance_testing#Software_engineering
- **Unit testing** is a process by which the smallest testable parts of an application, called *units*, are individually tested to verify that they perform as inspected
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing
- Below we are going to test our previously introduced `hashCode()` function to discover how effective it is at creating unique keys - the demo code below is in the **9A-hashing.zip** file in myCourses:
  - [Creating unique and repeatable keys by *hashing*](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/hash-as-key.md) - see the  **hashing.html** demo file - we looked at this on 8A - both the "short" and "long" versions of the algorithm seemed to function the same - *OR did they?!*
  - Go ahead and run **hashing-conformance-test.html** - it tests various hashing algorithms for the number of collisions (common hashes) when working with a dictionary of 274937 words - with widely varying results:
    - `badHashCode()` - adding up ASCI values - gives 272990 collisions
    - `betterHashCode()` - the "multiply by 31" method - gives 7764 collisions
    - `hashCode()` - the bitshifting method - gives 9 collisions (also try varying the bitshift value, as well as  `- prevHash`, to see how the results vary)
    - `md5()` - an industry standard hashing/encryption algorithm that we are importing - gives 0 collisions
  - So `betterHashCode()` and `hashCode()` did NOT give the same results in JavaScript, despite what this Stackoverflow post said:
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51960331/why-5-bit-left-shift-in-hashing-function
    - The lesson is - test your code to be sure!

## III. Web Components - creating `<main-app>`

- Let's look at how you can "wrap" all of your web components into a single "root" web component
- See the **web-component-wrap-up.zip** file in myCourses

## IV. React Demo
- React - *A JavaScript library for building user interfaces*:
  - https://reactjs.org/
  - https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html
- Let's take a look at a couple of React examples - see the **web-component-wrap-up.zip** file in myCourses
