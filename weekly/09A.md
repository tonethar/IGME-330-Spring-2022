## I. Conformance testing

- **Software conformance testing** is testing that verifies that a product performs according to its specified standards
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformance_testing#Software_engineering
- **Unit testing** is a process by which the smallest testable parts of an application, called *units*, are individually tested to verify that they perform as inspected
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing
- Below we are going to test our previously introduced `hash()` function to discover how effective it is at creating unique keys:
  - [Creating unique and repeatable keys by *hashing*](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/hash-as-key.md) - we looked at this on 8A - both the "short" and "long" versions of the algorithm seemed to function the same - *OR did they?!*

## III. Web Components - creating `<main-app>`

- Let's look at how you can "wrap" all of your web components into a single "root" web component
- See the **web-component-wrap-up.zip** file in myCourses

## IV. React Demo
- React - *A JavaScript library for building user interfaces*:
  - https://reactjs.org/
  - https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html
- Let's take a look at a couple of React examples - see the **web-component-wrap-up.zip** file in myCourses
