## I. Conformance testing

- **Software conformance testing** is testing that verifies that a product performs according to its specified standards
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformance_testing#Software_engineering
- **Unit testing** is a process by which the smallest testable parts of an application, called *units*, are individually tested to verify that they perform as inspected. Typically this "unit" is a function or a method.
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing
- Below we are going to test our previously introduced `hashCode()` function to discover how effective it is at creating unique keys - the demo code below is in the **9A-hashing.zip** file in myCourses:
  - [Creating unique and repeatable keys by *hashing*](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/hash-as-key.md) - see the  **hashing.html** demo file - we looked at this on 8A - both the "short" and "long" versions of the algorithm seemed to function the same - *OR did they?!*
  - Go ahead and run **hashing-conformance-test.html** - it tests various hashing algorithms for the number of collisions (common hashes) when working with a dictionary of 274937 words - with widely varying results:
    - `badHashCode()` - adding up ASCI values - gives 272990 collisions
    - `betterHashCode()` - the "multiply by 31" method - gives 7764 collisions
    - `hashCode()` - the bitshifting method - gives 9 collisions (also try varying the bitshift value, as well as  `- prevHash`, to see how the results vary)
    - `md5()` - an industry standard hashing/encryption algorithm that we are importing - gives 0 collisions
  - So `betterHashCode()` and `hashCode()` did NOT give the same results in JavaScript, despite what this Stackoverflow post said:
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51960331/why-5-bit-left-shift-in-hashing-function
    - The lesson is - test your code to be sure!

## II. Performance Testing
- In our previous section, `md5()` gave zero collisions, so just use that rather than our home-grown `hashCode()` function:
  - Not so fast! Did you notice that `md5()` took noticeably longer to execute in the browser?
  - Let's write a test to see how much *time* in taks the browser to perform our various hashing algorithms on the dictionary of words we've been using. This will be a simple performance test - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_performance_testing
  - See this article here for some ideas on how to time your JavaScript:
    - https://levelup.gitconnected.com/different-ways-to-measure-performance-in-javascript-94785075ab96
    - [`console.time()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/time) and [`console.timeEnd()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/timeEnd) will get the job done
    - see **hashing-performance-test.html** to see the results
    - on my 6.5 year old Mac:
      - Bitshifting and `array.reduce()` in `hashCode()` was 2.5x *slower* than the simple multiplication used in `betterHashCode()`
      - `hashCode()` was 25x *faster* than `md5()`
    - which hashing function would you use?
- Other stuff to keep in mind about performance testing:
  - Order matters when running these simple tests because of browser memory management, so swapping the order of these tests will give you different results. Automated performance tools often handle this for you.
  - In your applications, if you have long running activities that might lock up the browser UI, consider a Web Worker: 
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers

## III. Web Components - creating `<main-app>`

- Let's look at how you can "wrap" all of your web components into a single "root" web component
- See the **web-component-wrap-up.zip** file in myCourses

<hr>

## IV. React Demo
- React - *A JavaScript library for building user interfaces*:
  - https://reactjs.org/
  - https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html
- Let's take a look at a couple of React examples - see the **web-component-wrap-up.zip** file in myCourses
