# Week 11A

## I. Exam #2 is next time (Thursday 3/31) - what's on it?

- Everything we have covered through as of our previous class (10B) is fair game
- Study Aids:
  - *Quiz #3* reviews the 6A-9A topics (web apps) nicely
  - As far as the canvas topics (9B-10B):
    - look over [Canvas-1](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/1-canvas-intro-to-drawing-context.md) through Canvas-4
    - *Canvas Study Guide #1* (which we handed out and reviewed in class) would also be good to study
