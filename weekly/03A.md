# Week 3A - Review of weeks 1 & 2

## I. Announcement Quiz #1

- Quiz #1 will be given this Thursday 1/27 (3B, next class)
  - has a fairly low grade weight, it counts as a “checkoff” assignment
  - 10 questions, a mix of conceptual and “write some code”
  - BRING A PEN/PENCIL. This will be on paper!
  - topics are: functions, arrays, XML, JSON
  - you should review weeks 1A-2B and your notes
  - will have 15 minutes at end of class
  - no "makeups" without prior approval
  - the quiz is primarily about giving formative feedback to help prepare you for the first exam - so don’t stress out over it :-)
  - if you have any questions, DM them to me here in Slack
