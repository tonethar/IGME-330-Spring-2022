# Week 9B - Intro To Canvas

## Overview

- Talk about the canvas drawing API

<hr>

## I. What is canvas?
- Canvas is a 2D bitmap drawing API that allows the developer to write code that draws shapes and images into a browser window without the need for a plug-in like Flash or Java.

  - Concepts:
    - What is canvas?
    - Alternative drawing APIs
    - Obtaining a *drawing context* and performing simple drawing (rectangles)
  - Docs:
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element
    - Get a *drawing context*
      - [`canvas.getContext("2d")`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/getContext)
    - Canvas *convenience* methods:
      - [`ctx.fillRect()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/fillRect)
      - [`ctx.strokeRect()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/strokeRect)
    - Canvas *drawing state* properties:
      - [`ctx.fillStyle`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/fillStyle)

  - Concepts:
    - animation & writing a helper function
  - Docs:
    - [`window.requestAnimationFrame()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame)
- 4 - [Canvas 2D Essential Skills #4 - Adding Controls](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/4-adding-controls.md)
  - Concepts:
    - Adding interactivity to our screensaver with a simple UI
    - Toggling animation on & off
    - Getting coordinates of where the user clicks on the canvas
    - Drawing state *stack*
    - "Pure" functions with no "side effects" - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function
  - Docs:
    - [`ctx.save()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/save)
    - [`ctx.restore()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/restore)
- 5 - [Canvas 2D Essential Skills #5 - Write some code!](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/5-write-some-code.md)
  - No video
  - You will writing code that creates new helper functions and UI
  - Recommendation: this should not be particularly difficult, but don't put it off until an hour before it's due

## IV. Togetherness Activity for 9B - Canvas Study Guide #1

- See myCourses for the starter code file - **sg-1.html**
- We will hand out a paper copy of SG-1 (we are not collecting this, but it will likely help on the next exam)
- There IS an extra-credit checkoff dropbox for the last part - **IV. Make Something**
- Handy links:
  - The canvas API is focused on drawing, and is fairly lightweight. The full specification is here: http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/
  - Our free canvas "textbook" is located here: https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/HTML-canvas-guide/Introduction/Introduction.html
  - Another great online reference is here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial
- Now we'll walk through this SG together - and let you get started on the extra credit
