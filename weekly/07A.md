# Week 7A

## I. Review Exam-1

### I-A. Working With Arrays

- [5B - Quiz #2 Review](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Spring-2022/blob/main/weekly/05B.md#part-a---string-production)
- #1-2) needed `.map()` and `.join()`
- #3-4) nested array of objects
- #5-6) arrays are reference types. Remember that `const` refers to the variable *binding* being immutable - so a reference type like an array can still be modified EVEN if the array is delared with `const`

### I-B. Adding Structure to Data

- [5B - Quiz #2 Review](05B.md#part-b---adding-structure-to-data)
- In XML, don't forget that *root element*!
- In JSON, you need one too, and it's either a `[]` or a `{}` (more commonly the latter)
- The best way to structure the individual dog data is to cluster it together in either a containing tag (XML) or an Object literal (JSON)
- Instead, a lot of the answers used the dreaded [*parallel array*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_array)

**XML EXAMPLE - NOT SO GOOD:**

```xml
<dog-finder>
  <names>"Luna","Mocha"</names>
  <ages>4,10</ages>
</dog-finder>
```

**XML EXAMPLE - BETTER:**

```xml
<adoptable-dogs>
  <title>Dog Finder</title>
  <dog>
    <name>Luna</name>
    <age>4</age>
  </dog>
  <dog>
    <name>Mocha</name>
    <age>10</age>
  </dog>
</adoptable-dogs>
```

**JSON EXAMPLE - NOT SO GOOD:**

```json
{
  "adoptable-dogs": {
    "title" : ["Dog Finder"],
    "names" : ["Luna","Mocha"],
    "ages" : [4,10]
  }
}
```

### I-C. ES6 Modules

- [5B - Quiz #2 Review](05B.md#part-c---es6-modules)

### I-D. JSON

- [HW - Ajax-4 - loading and parsing JSON files](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-4.md)
- The same quetion was on Quiz #1


### I-E. Web Components

- [HW - Web Components-1 - Intro to Web Components](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-wc-1.md)

### I-F. JS & DOM

- *on the exam, you could be asked about CSS selectors (type, class, id, attribute) - so know what they are and be sure you can write a simple CSS rule using them*
  - from [5B - Quiz #2 Review](05B.md#part-g---fix-the-code)
  - [Ajax-3](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-3.md) demoed CSS attribute selectors
  - [6A - `localStorage` demo](06A.md#iv-localstorage-demo) had a CSS attribute selector
  - you will see this again!

### I-G. Other

- `addEventListener()` question was from here - https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-technobabble.md#iv-review-questions-from-notes--video---reference-links-below-will-help-too
- ES6 modules automatically run in strict mode and `defer` by default

## II. Project 1 Checkpoint #2

- Look at [Project 1 - Checkpoint #2 submissions](../projects/p1-checkpoint-2.md#i-checkpoint-rubric-first) (~~all~~ ~~almost all~~ ~~most~~ *some* of you are done!)
- Things worth pointing out on the *DogFinder* demo:
  - 
- Discuss [Project 1 - Final Requirements](../projects/p1-final.md)
  - we will have a more detailed dicussion next time, after everyone has submitted Checkpoint #2

<hr>

## III.The `fetch()` API

- `fetch()` is optional for Checkpoint #2, and required for the final version of Project 1 .. so we won't look at it too closely until next week
  - [HW - Ajax-5 - the fetch() API](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-5.md)
  - [HW - Ajax-6 - async & await with the fetch() API](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-6.md)

## IV. Firebase HW
- This is due Saturday night, but we are discussing it (extensively) next time
  - [1 - Intro to Firebase - the Realtime Database](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/firebase-1.md)
  - [2 - Firebase Highscore App](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/firebase-2.md)
  - [3 - Firebase Highscore Viewer](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/firebase-3.md)
