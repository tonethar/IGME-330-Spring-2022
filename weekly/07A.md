# Week 7A

## I. Review Exam-1

### I-A. Working With Arrays

- [5B - Quiz #2 Review](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Spring-2022/blob/main/weekly/05B.md#part-a---string-production)
- #1-2) needed `.map()` and `.join()`
- #3-4) nested array of objects
- #5-6) arrays are reference types. Remember that `const` refers to the variable *binding* being immutable - so a reference type can still be modified EVEN if the array is delared with `const`

### I-B. Adding Structure to Data

- [5B - Quiz #2 Review](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Spring-2022/blob/main/weekly/05B.md#part-b---adding-structure-to-data)
- The best way to structure the dog data is to cluster it together in either a containing tag (XML) or an Object literal (JSON)
- Instead, a lot of the answers used the dreaded [*parallel array*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_array)

**XML EXAMPLE - NOT SO GOOD:**

```xml
<adoptable-dogs>
  <dog age="4">Luna</dog>
  <dog age="10">Mocha</dog>
</adoptable-dogs>
```

**XML EXAMPLE - BETTER:**

```xml
<adoptable-dogs>
  <dog age="4">Luna</dog>
  <dog age="10">Mocha</dog>
</adoptable-dogs>
```


### I-C. ES6 Modules

- [5B - Quiz #2 Review](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Spring-2022/blob/main/weekly/05B.md#part-c---es6-modules)

### I-D. JSON

- [HW - Ajax-4 - loading and parsing JSON files](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-4.md)


### I-E. Web Components

- [HW - Web Components-1 - Intro to Web Components](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-wc-1.md)

### I-F. JS & DOM

- *on the exam, you could be asked about CSS selectors (type, class, id, attribute) - so know what they are and be sure you can write a simple CSS rule using them*
  - from [5B - Quiz #2 Review](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Spring-2022/blob/main/weekly/05B.md#part-g---fix-the-code)
  - [Ajax-3](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-3.md) demoed CSS attribute selectors
  - [6A - `localStorage` demo](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Spring-2022/blob/main/weekly/06A.md#iv-localstorage-demo) had a CSS attribute selector
  - you will see this again!

### I-G. Other

- `addEventLister()` question was from here - https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-technobabble.md#iv-review-questions-from-notes--video---reference-links-below-will-help-too
- ES6 modules automatcally run in strict mdoe and `defer` by default
