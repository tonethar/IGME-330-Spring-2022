# Week 5B

## I. Review Quiz #2

### Part A - String Production 
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join

### Part B - Adding structure to data
- XML syntax rules:
  - https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-3.md#ii-about-xml
  - N.B. - don't worry about having to remember the XML declaration at the top of an XML file! THis is because it is not required if the document is either UTF-8 or UTF-16 format
- JSON syntax rules:
  - https://www.json.org/json-en.html
  - https://medium.com/omarelgabrys-blog/json-in-a-nutshell-7d638dfea7cc
  - N.B. - the "root" of a valid JSON file can be either `{ }` OR `[ ]` - but the former is more common
  - In JSON, ALL object keys MUST be strings and MUST be quoted (unlike a JS object literal)
  - BTW - when creating your own JSON files, you don't need to make it deliberately harder to parse like we did with **pet-names.json** in [HW - Ajax-4 - loading and parsing JSON files](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-4.md)


### Part C - ES6 Modules
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export

### Part D - Bulma
- https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-bulma-1.md

### Part E - Web Components
- https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-wc-1.md
- https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-wc-2.md
- https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-wc-3.md
- https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-wc-4.md
- https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-wc-5.md
- We also covered *slots* on 4B - see Slack for posted demo
- We "wrapped up" Web Components on [Week 5A](./05A.md#ii-finish-up-web-components)

### Part F - JavaScript Events
- https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/blackout-poetry-maker.md
- https://javascript.info/bubbling-and-capturing
- Also fair game on the exam - custom events: [HW - Web Components-5 - Dispatching Custom Events](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-wc-5.md)

### Part G - Fix the Code
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode#strict_mode_for_modules
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#other_differences_between_modules_and_standard_scripts
- *on the exam, you could be asked about CSS selectors (type, class, id, attribute) - so know what they are and be sure you can write a simple CSS rule using them*
- *you should also understand variable block scoping that `let` and `const` use - and that a variable declared with these can't be accessed until AFTER it has been declared*:
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/block

### Part H - Be a human linter
- https://eslint.org/demo

## IV. Test your API!
- Head to myCourses and grab the "API Tester" file again
- Get this working with your Project 1 API - when the "Load Data" button is clicked - some of the API data is written to the `#output` <div> so that we can see that you can get your API functioning in a web browser
- ZIP and POST to the myCourses dropbox - it's due at 11:59PM tonight
