# Week 2B - Ajax (XML & JSON)

## I. Creating an XHR Helper Function

## II. Lecture: Ajax - loading XML

- [HW - Ajax-3 - loading and parsing XML files](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-3.md)
- In the example above, the XML file we created to encode the pet name data is structured in an extremely simple way. In the "real world" you would probably have a lot of information that would be associated with each pet name
- Below is an example file that allows us to store more complex data in the XML file, in this case an `id`, a `rating`, a `numLikes` and a suggested `gender` for each pet name

**pet-names-2.xml**
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<petnames>
  <namelist cid="dognames">
  	<name rating="5" gender="female">Bella</name>
  	<name rating="5" gender="female">Luna</name>
  	<name rating="4" gender="both">Charlie</name>
  	<name rating="4" gender="female">Lucy</name>
  	<name rating="3" gender="both">Cooper</name>
  <namelist cid="catnames">
  	<name rating="5" gender="male">Oliver</name>
  	<name rating="5" gender="male">Leo</name>
  	<name rating="4" gender="both">Milo</name>
  	<name rating="4" gender="both">Charlie</name>
  	<name rating="5" gender="both">Simba</name>
  </namelist>
</petnames>
```

- This file would be a little more complicated to load and parase than **pet-names.xml** was, but we would also be able to display more information to the user, sort and filter the results based on values of specific attributes, etc
