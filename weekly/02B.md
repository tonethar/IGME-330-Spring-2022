## II. Lecture: Ajax - loading XML

- [HW - Ajax-3 - loading and parsing XML files](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-3.md)
- In the example above, the XML file we created to encode the pet name data is structured in an extremely simple way. In the "real world" you would probably have a lot of additional information that would be associated with each specific pet name
- Below is an example file that allows us to store more complex data in the XML file, in this case a `uid`, a `rating`, a `numLikes` and a suggested `gender` for each pet name

**pet-names-2.xml**
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<petnames>
  <namelist cid="dognames">
  	<name uid="7174d633-9231-4c9e-8142-b206e20d8cd2" numLikes="1780" rating="5" gender="female">Bella</name>
  	<name uid="d63c43ca-adc2-4cdc-b3f6-2c7c2c12b6c3" numLikes="3216" rating="5" gender="female">Luna</name>
  	<name uid="e3d0ecfd-31ef-482c-a0d1-5fa6b1cb1dee" numLikes="9301" rating="4" gender="both">Charlie</name>
  	<name uid="9a29e788-5b39-490f-a666-293309b776c2" numLikes="998" rating="4" gender="female">Lucy</name>
  	<name uid="fa9f90ed-b7d6-4901-859c-6575dbfc0cb6" numLikes="6102" rating="3" gender="both">Cooper</name>
  </namelist>
  <namelist cid="catnames">
  	<name uid="3f7f5111-2c16-4bb0-8376-85dacf25f69c" numLikes="8763" rating="5" gender="male">Oliver</name>
  	<name uid="72a1c899-2a5f-465a-acf1-c8663c25b942" numLikes="4199" rating="5" gender="male">Leo</name>
  	<name uid="f5e5c879-53e6-4675-8b18-c7d51df847d2" numLikes="2563" rating="4" gender="both">Milo</name>
  	<name uid="b64cf07b-f8a8-4798-8465-686659b43a45" numLikes="4994" rating="4" gender="both">Charlie</name>
  	<name uid="96e473b4-6776-42d2-8b10-172515ec4eb8" numLikes="2587" rating="5" gender="both">Simba</name>
  </namelist>
</petnames>
```

- This file would be a little more complicated to load and parse than **pet-names.xml** was, but we would also be able to display more information to the user, sort and filter the results based on values of specific attributes, etc
- One obvious limitation of XML is that we can't specify *data types* in our XML in a standardized way. Instead, we are instead required to just "know" that `numLikes` and `rating` are both numeric, and that `gender` is a string. 
- The above issue is solved by the JSON format - see below

## III. For your review

- [HW - Ajax-4 - loading and parsing JSON files](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-4.md)
- In this JSON example above we can see that the name data is clearly stored in JS object literal format, which means we have support for data types such as objects, arrays, string, numbers and booleans
- NOTE: **pet-names.json** was deliberately created with arbitrarily named top level key name such as `"c9532dc9"`, which made it more of a challenge to parse. You will often get web service data back structured in such a way, so it's good practice for you to have experience parsing JSON data that is structured this way 
- But a better way to structure the JSON (and many web services structure things this way) would be to give a meaningful top level unique identifier to each set of pet names, which would make them easier to look up (ex. `dognames` replacing `c9532dc9` and `catnames` replacing `69bab900` below):

**pet-names-2.json**

```json
{
  "dognames": {
		"type": "dognames",
		"popularity": 5,
		"title": "Dog Names",
		"namelist": ["Bella", "Luna", "Charlie", "Lucy", "Cooper", "Max", "Bailey", "Daisy", "Sadie", "Lola", "Buddy", "Molly", "Stella", "Tucker", "Bear", "Zoey", "Duke", "Harley", "Maggie", "Jax"]
  },
  "catnames": {
		"type": "catnames",
		"popularity": 4,
		"title": "Cat Names",
		"namelist": ["Oliver", "Leo", "Milo", "Charlie", "Simba", "Max", "Jack", "Loki", "Tiger", "Jasper", "Ollie", "Oscar", "George", "Buddy", "Toby", "Smokey", "Finn", "Felix", "Simon", "Shadow"]
  }
}
```
